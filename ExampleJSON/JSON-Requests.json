- This file contains the JSON which is sent to the REST backend and performs operations on the database.
- If done in order from top to bottom then all works.
- There are many kinks in this application due to time restraints but this gives an example of what can be done.
- Each use case is stated, followed by the request and url and the JSON to send.
- Any application which can send requests in JSON format can be used, however, this was tested using Postman and proved 
  an excellent aid in testing.
